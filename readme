# AI Study Buddy for Computational Complexity
## Author: LM Travis

A web-based application built with Streamlit that helps users study and learn about computational complexity. The app features a quiz mode where users can test their knowledge and an AI helper mode where users can ask questions and receive answers. This application is designed to enhance understanding of computational complexity concepts, which are fundamental in computer science.

### Features
- **Quiz Mode**: Test your knowledge of computational complexity with a random question generator.
- **AI Helper**: Ask the AI any question about computational complexity and receive a response.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.10+
- ai_helper module (included in the repository)
- database module (included in the repository)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-study-buddy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-study-buddy
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```


### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.10+
- ai_helper module (included in the repository)
- database module (included in the repository)

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.10+
- ai_helper module (included in the repository)
- database module (included in the repository)


### Usage
- Open the application in your web browser: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- Switch between Quiz Mode and AI Helper Mode using the tabs.
- In Quiz Mode, answer the question and submit your response.
- In AI Helper Mode, ask a question such as "What is P vs NP?" or "Explain the concept of NP-completeness."
